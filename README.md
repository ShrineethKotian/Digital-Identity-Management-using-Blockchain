# Digital-Identity-Management-using-Blockchain

Digital Identity Management is a new identity management model in which the holder of the identity data really have the ownership of their own identity data and have full access control over it without involving any intervenor. This has created in huge amount of user information with the service providers, resulting in two difficulties, user owned private data is saved and left to the care of such third party applications and the user does not have ownership of his own data. Maintenance of such multiple identities will only become more difficult as the digital era unfolds. We attempt to solve this problem by using the Blockchain technology for digital identities. Blockchain is an enabling technology for building Digital Identity that offers a decentralized and secure environment. A blockchain's data is cryptographically connected and distributed across multiple computers, making them nearly impossible to temper with. Hence, Blockchain technology is the best and the secured platform to build Digital Identity. The existing system of identity management is neither secure nor reliable. Therefore, the blockchain can create a path to Digital Identity through decentralized networks, which will assure privacy, trust and security.
